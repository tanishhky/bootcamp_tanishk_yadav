**SUBJECT:** Deconstructing the Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio

This document outlines our plan to analyze Berkshire Hathaway's public stock portfolio. Our goal is to translate their strategy into actionable insights for you.

We will focus on three core areas:
1.  **Risk Assessment**: Calculating the portfolio's overall market risk (beta) to understand if it's more or less aggressive than the market average (S&P 500).
2.  **Concentration Analysis**: Identifying the key stocks and sectors that drive the portfolio's performance.
3.  **Performance Benchmarking**: Seeing how the portfolio has performed against the S&P 500.

The final deliverable will be a report that clearly visualizes these findings, enabling you to apply these principles to your own investment decisions.
