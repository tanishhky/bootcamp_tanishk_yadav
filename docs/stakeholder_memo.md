### Stakeholder Memo

**To:** Head of Customer Retention

**From:** Data Science Team

**Date:** August 15, 2025

**Subject:** Project Proposal: Predictive Churn Model to Address Recent Increase in Customer Attrition

This memo outlines a project to address the recent 15% increase in customer churn. Our goal is to develop a predictive model that will allow us to identify customers at high risk of leaving our service.

By leveraging historical data on customer behavior, we can build a tool that will empower the Customer Success team to proactively engage with at-risk customers. The final deliverable will be a dashboard that not only flags these customers but also provides insights into *why* they are at risk.

We are confident that this data-driven approach will enable us to make more informed decisions and, ultimately, reduce our churn rate. We look forward to collaborating with you on this important initiative.
